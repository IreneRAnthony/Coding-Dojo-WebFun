        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
            variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum felxibility for developers
            to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser
            or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic
            control over them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Variable Decleration:</span> JavaScript variables are containers for
                    storing data
                    values - imagine a
                    cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                    variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span
                        class="highlight">var x;
                    </span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Variable Assignment:</span> Assignment operators assign values to
                    JavaScript
                    variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The =
                    assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Data Types:</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
                    operate om
                    variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
                    primatives:
                    Boolean - <span class="highlight">true </span>or <span class="highlight"> false;</span> null
                    -<span class="highlight">null </span> aka nothing; Number<span class="highlight"> 42</span> or
                    <span class="highlight">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="highlight">"Coding Dojo
                        Rocks!";</span> Array -
                    <span class="highlight">[1, 'Coding Dojo', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="highlight">
                        {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Conditionals:</span> When you write code, you want to preform different
                    actions
                    for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have
                    been
                    met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: <span class="highlight">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this
                    code in
                    our code block; <span class="highlight">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if
                    the first
                    condition is false; <span class="highlight">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Loops:</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every
                    programming
                    language , but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of
                    times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
                    stop.
                    That's a loop!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="underlined">Function:</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code of block. When
                    we call
                    our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example
                    imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
                    started,
                    first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We
                    finished
                    our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and
                    over
                    and over again.</p>
